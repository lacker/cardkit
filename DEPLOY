How to deploy this.

Digital Ocean is at 45.55.220.119

ssh in there, cd to cardkit

`git pull` to update the code

`npm run build` to update the static files for nginx

`./runserver` to run the node server - although it should be nohupped so normally you don't need to do this, only if you want to test out a server change.

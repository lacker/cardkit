#How To Deploy

## Connect to Digital Ocean

ssh to 45.55.220.119
(talk to Kevin for access)
  
## Update the Code

    `cd cardkit`
    `git pull`
    `npm install` # in case you need new node dependencies
    `npm run build` # update the static files for nginx

## Kill and Restart Server

To run the node server, first kill any running one.

    `ps aux | grep server`
    `kill -9 <process id>`

Start the server in the background:
    `nohup ./runserver &`

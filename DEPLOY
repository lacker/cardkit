How to deploy this.

Digital Ocean is at 45.55.220.119

ssh in there, cd to cardkit

`git pull` to update the code

`npm install` in case you need new node dependencies

`npm run build` to update the static files for nginx

to run the node server, first kill any running one.
check with `ps aux | grep server` to see what's running.
use `kill -9 <process id>` to kill things.

`nohup ./runserver &` runs the node server in the background.

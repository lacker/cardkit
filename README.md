# Spacetime

A real-time, space-themed, ccg-genre game. 

Try it at [spacetime.tv](http://spacetime.tv)

# Pure Javascript

This is both a great game, and an experiment in pure Javascript.

Spacetime uses ES6, React, BabelJS, and Node.

# Setup

Set up with `npm install`

`npm start` runs the client locally at localhost:8080 (or you can use /webpack_dev_server/ if you prefer)

`./runserver` runs the server locally at localhost:9090

Note: To test locally, open two browser windows pointing at localhost:8080

The initial config and layout is based on http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-single-page-react-web-app-with-react-router-and-webpack/

# Misc

Static files in prod are configured by mucking around with links in /www/data

# cardkit
A bunch of tools for building card games.

Set up with `npm install`

`npm start` runs locally at localhost:8080 (or you can use /webpack_dev_server/ if you prefer)

The initial setup is based on http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-single-page-react-web-app-with-react-router-and-webpack/
